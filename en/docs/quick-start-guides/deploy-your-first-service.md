# Deploy Your First Service

Choreo, an Internal Developer Platform (IDevP), simplifies the deployment, monitoring, and management of your cloud-native services, allowing you to focus on innovation and implementation.

Choreo allows you to easily deploy services you've created in your preferred programming language in just a few steps.

In this guide, you will:

- Use a pre-implemented service that has resources to maintain a book list. 
- Build and deploy the service in Choreo using the `Nodejs` buildpack. It runs on port 8080.
- Test the service.

## Prerequisites

1.  You will need a GitHub account with a repository that contains your service implementation. To follow this guide you can fork the [Choreo sample book list service repository](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-sample-book-list-service/), which contains the sample for this guide.

2. If you are signing in to the Choreo Console for the first time, create an organization as follows:

    1. Go to [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/), and sign in using your Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account.
    2. Enter a unique organization name. For example, `Stark Industries`.
    3. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms of use.
    4. Click **Create**.

    This creates the organization and opens the organization home page.

### Learn the repository file structure

Let's familiarize ourselves with the key files in this sample application. The below table gives a brief overview of the important files in the sample book list service.

!!! note 
    The following file paths are relative to the path <choreo-sample-book-list-service>/
    
|Filepath               |Description                                                                   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|app.mjs	            |The Node.js (JavaScript) based service code.|
|.choreo/endpoints.yaml	|Choreo-specific configuration that provides information about how Choreo exposes the service.|
|openapi.yaml	        |OpenAPI contract of the service. This is required to publish our service as a managed API. This openapi.yaml file is referenced by the .choreo/endpoints.yaml.|

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create a multi repository project 

Follow the steps given below to create a multi repository project:

!!! info
     A multi repository project allows you to maintain multiple repositories and dedicate each of them to specific components or modules in your project. 

1. Go to [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/) and sign in. This opens the organization home page.
2. On the organization home page, click **+ Create Project**.
3. Enter a unique name and description for the project. You can enter the name and description given below:

    | **Field**       | **Value**               |
    |-----------------|-------------------------|
    | **Name**        | Book List project       |
    | **Description** | My sample multi repository project |

4. Select **Multi Repository**.
5. Click **Create**.

## Step 2: Create a service component

Let's create a service component by following these steps:

1. In the landing page, under **Connect Your Code**, click on the **Service** card.
2. Enter a unique name and a description of the service. For this guide, let's enter the following values:

    |Field          |     Value              |
    |---------------|------------------------|
    |Name           | Book List              |
    |Description    | Gets the book list     |

3. Select the **GitHub** tab.
4. If you have not already connected your GitHub repository to Choreo, click **Authorize with GitHub**, enter your GitHub credentials, and select the repository you created by forking [Choreo sample book list service repository](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-sample-book-list-service/)s to install the [Choreo GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/choreo-apps). 

    !!! info
         The **Choreo GitHub App** requires the following permissions:
         
        - Read and write access to code and pull requests.
        - Read access to issues and metadata.
             
        You can [revoke access](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations#reviewing-your-authorized-github-apps) if you do not want Choreo to have access to your GitHub account. However, write access is only used to send pull requests to a user repository. Choreo will not directly push any changes to a repository.



5. Enter the following information:

    | **Field**             | **Description**                               |
    |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
    | **GitHub Account**    | Your account                                  |
    | **GitHub Repository** | choreo-sample-book-list-service |
    | **Branch**            | main                             |

6. Select the buildpack **NodeJS**.
7. Enter the following information.

    | **Field**             | **Description**                               |
    |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|    
    | **NodeJS Project Directory**       | /reading-list-service |
    | **Language Version**              | 20.x.x |

8. Click **Create**. Once the component creation is complete, you will see the component overview page.

You have successfully created a Service component with the NodeJS buildpack. Now let's build and deploy the service.

## Step 3: Build and deploy
Now that you have connected the source repository, and configured the endpoint details, it's time to build the service. Choreo will create a Docker image in the build process. You can then deploy the built Docker image and test the book list service.

### Step 3.1: Build

To build the service, follow these steps:

1. Select the component you created from the **Components Listing**.
1. From the left navigation, go to the **Build** page and click **Build**.
2. Select the latest commit and click **Build**.
3. Check the deployment progress by observing the console logs on the right of the page.

    !!! note
        Building the service component may take a while. You can track the progress by observing the logs. Once the build process is complete, the build status changes to **Success**.

### Step 3.2: Deploy

Next, to deploy this service, follow these steps: 

1. In the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.
2. On the **Set Up** card, click **Configure &  Deploy**.
3. Skip configuring the **Environment Configurations** and click **Next**.
4. Skip adding a **File Mount**. Click **Next**.
5. Review the **Endpoint Details** and click **Deploy**.

    !!! note
        Deploying the service component may take a while. You can track the progress by observing the logs. Once the deploying is complete, the build status changes to **Active** on the **Development** environment card.

## Step 4: Test the service

To test the **Book List** service via the integrated OpenAPI Console in Choreo, follow the steps given below:

1. In the Choreo Console left navigation menu, click **Test** and then click **Console**.
2. In the OpenAPI Console that opens, select **Development** from the environment drop-down list.
3. In the **Endpoint** list, select **Books REST Endpoint**.
4. Expand the **GET /books** method and click **Try it out**.
5. Click **Execute**.
6. Check the **Server Response** section. 

Similarly, you can expand and try out the other methods.

After you have successfully tested your service, you can now try out various other Choreo features such as [managing](../api-management/lifecycle-management.md), [observing](../monitoring-and-insights/observability-overview.md), [DevOps](../devops-and-ci-cd/view-runtime-details.md), etc., similar to any other component type within Choreo.
