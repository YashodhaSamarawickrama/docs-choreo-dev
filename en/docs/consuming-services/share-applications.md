Choreo's application-sharing feature allows you to share your applications with members within your organization. This facilitates collaborative efforts when there is a need for multiple members to work on the same application.

Follow the steps given below to share an application with members of your organization:

1. Sign in to the [Choreo Developer Portal](https://devportal.choreo.dev/) and click the **Applications** tab.
2. On the **Applications** page, click on the application you want to share.
3. On the **Application Overview** page that opens, click the **Share** button displayed on the right side.
4. In the **Share Application** dialog, enter one or more email addresses depending on the members with whom you want to share the applications.

    !!! note
         You must type an email address and press enter for it to get added.

5. Click **Confirm**. This will share the application in read-only mode with the specified members.
  
   To see the members with whom the application is shared, go to the **Application Overview** page and take a look at the email addresses in the **Shared with** field.
